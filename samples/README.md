# Sample

Here is a simple app that demonstrates the use of AppShortcuts.

In the app, there is a list of Monkeys, which you can pin, allowing you to navigate directly to a specific monkey, without having to trawl the extensive list.

For more information on how to implement the Plugin, follow the documentation [here](https://adenearnshaw.github.io/AppShortcutsPlugin)
